# Number-Guessing-Game
a small coded game by CPP

The Number guessing game is made by C++
using stdlib.h
we use rand() for giving random number

and then using a while loop and if-else ladder
we can easily make the game of number guessing.

if the random  number we get is HiddenNumber
then if guess > HiddenNumber
then it will return "Too High! Try again"
then if guess < HiddenNumber
then it will return "Too Low! Try again".
then  if guess == HiddenNumber
the it will tell "Congratulations!" and tell how many turns are needed to guess the right number.

Then it will return 0 as the code is succesful.
